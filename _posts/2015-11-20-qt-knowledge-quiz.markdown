Some time ago I announced that I am <a href="http://katecpp.github.io/qt-exam-preparations/" target="_blank">preparing myself for the Qt Essentials Exam</a>. In preparation I create the Qt knowledge quiz, which is a set of my self-invented questions with answers and explanations. After submitting answer, you will receive referral material which describes the topic of question (usually Qt Docs). I emphasize that these questions have nothing to do with real Qt Essentials questions. They can be helpful during the learning time to discover which parts of Qt material are poorly understood though.

At the moment the base contains 25 questions, anyway I am going to develop it constantly. I also welcome any comments, mistakes reports and suggestions.

The webpage itself isn't very fancy. The main goal of it is to be practical and user friendly.  So if you think that the appearance is austere, you're right. Maybe in some time I will tune it somehow.
