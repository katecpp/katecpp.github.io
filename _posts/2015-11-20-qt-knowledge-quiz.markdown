Some time ago I <a href="http://katecpp.github.io/qt-exam-preparations/" target="_blank">announced</a> that I am preparing myself for the **Qt Essentials Exam**. During the preparation I created the **Qt knowledge Quiz** (<a href="http://katecpp.github.io/qt_quiz/" target="_blank">play online</a>), which is a set of my self-invented questions with answers and explanations. After submitting answer, you will receive referral material with explanation describing the topic of question (usually Qt Docs). I emphasize that these questions have nothing to do with real Qt Essentials Exam questions. They can be helpful during the learning time to discover which parts of Qt material are poorly understood though.

<div class="centered">
<a href="http://katecpp.github.io/qt_quiz/" target="_blank">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/post-qt-quiz/play-qt-quiz.jpg" alt="Play Qt quiz" height="200" width="500"/>
</a>
</div>

At the moment the base contains **33 Qt related questions** covering both **Qt 4** and **Qt 5** parts. I am going to develop it constantly. I also welcome any comments, mistakes reports and suggestions.

The webpage itself isn't very fancy. The main goal of it is to be practical and user friendly. So if you think that the appearance is austere, you're right. Maybe in some time I will tune it somehow.

**Stay tuned for new questions!**
