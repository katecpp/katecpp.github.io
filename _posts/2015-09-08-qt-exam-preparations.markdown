At the beginning of the year I've set myself a goal to pass the Qt Essentials Exam until the end of 2015. The time went by and the end of the year is coming fast --- so it's the high time to start the preparations. I've heard the Essentials Exam is rather easy, anyway it's always good to be well prepared. During my study I want to collect some fundamentals into a set of questions and answers and create an unofficial web Qt Essentials quiz.

Creating the quiz will result in two profits: first, I have no experience with web development, so I will learn some web-basics. Second, more obvious, I will consolidate the knowledge on Qt and dig into things I might have missed during my career.

Quiz requirements:
<ol>
	<li>website of quiz will be done the easiest possible way; with the use of html, css and javascript,</li>
	<li>every question will be explained with the proof in form of quotes from literature or Qt docs.</li>
</ol>

All the questions will be created before I take the Qt Exam -- the content of this Exam is of course confidential and I don't want to take risk that somebody accuses me of inspiration in real questions. Because of that I do not promise that my quiz will guarantee anybody profit during the real exam.

I will publish my quiz once it's finished.
