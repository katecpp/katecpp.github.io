<h3>Thank you for visiting my online notepad!</h3>
<p>This is a place where I share my software-related thoughts, describe my projects or create some tutorials. You can expect to read here about C++, Qt library or embedded software development, but also some random stuff may appear here.</p>
<p>My nickname <b>katecpp</b> is a concatenation of my name and my favourite language.</p>
