<h3>Thank you for visiting my blog!</h3>
<p>This is a place where I share my software-related thoughts, describe my projects or create some tutorials. You can expect to read here about C++, Qt library or embedded software development, but also some random stuff may appear here.</p>
<p>My nickname <b>katecpp</b> is a concatenation of my name and my favourite language. I graduated from Wroclaw University of Technology in 2014 and now I am working as embedded software developer in automotive industry.</p>
